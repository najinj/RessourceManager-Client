## Minty Resource Manager Application
This Repo represents the backend project for the Minty Resource Manager Application, which allow users 
to search and eventually book custom resources defined by the admin in the back-office part of the application.
The reason why it's called minty is because I love mint :herb:.

## Motivation
The main reason why I wanted to create this app is that I have previously done a similar one two years ago back 
when I was still in college :school:, and  I wanted to know how much I have matured since :grin:.

So you can call it a remaster version :sparkles: if you like, it still needs some additional work and improvements but overall I'm happy with it ðŸ˜„ . The first application was made using (MVC Pattern with PHP, JQuery, HTML).
you can find it here.

This Version is built using .NET Core, MongoDB, and React for the client-side.

2. Reservation settings: which is a set of rules that applies when a user tries to book a resource 
     (eg: An admin can define the maximum duration that a user can book, 
      he can define the maximum date in the future :calendar: that a user is allowed to book ... and so on)
3. Calendar Settings: which controls the display of the calendar (things like min/max hour :clock730:, first day of the week :date:,12/24h hours format)
